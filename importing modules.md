Importing module can save programmers a lot of time and avoid a lot of repetitive work. 
The commonly used function are stored in the system in advance, and programmers 
can use it by very simple operate when they needed, which is of great help to the 
programmer's workload and code visibility. In addition to the modules that come with 
Python itself, programmers can also write their own commonly used modules in advance and store them in the system, 
and they can be used in any program at any time with the same simple operation. Because we are just beginners now, 
the length of the code, the complexity and the capacity of the data which need to be processed are very elementary, 
so I canâ€™t feel the importance of the importing module. However, I have read the code of some advanced programs on Google. 
There may be dozens or hundreds of importing modules alone. Imagine the amount of work required to write t
hese into the code every single time when people need to use it in programming if there are no importing modules.
