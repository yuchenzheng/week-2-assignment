Chapter 1
1.Operators: *, -,  /, +
     Values: ‘hello’, -88.8, 5
2. String: ‘spam’.   Variable: spam
3. Integers, floating numbers, string
4. Expression made by values and operators
5. Expression is single value, statement not
6. Still 20, since ‘bacon = 20’ set the bacon as 20, ‘bacon + 1’ doesn’t change the value of bacon
7. Both of these evaluate to ‘spamspamspam’
8. Because ‘100’ began as a number, which is invalid as a variable
9. Int(), float(), str()
10. Because ’99’ is an integer, we cannot use ‘+’ to combine the string and integer, we should change 99 to str(99)

Chapter 2
1.True and false, we should write it as ’True’ and ‘False’
2.and, or, not
3.True and True = True
  True or False = True
  True or True = True
  False and True = False
  False and False = False
  False or False = False
  Not True = False
  Not False = Sure
4.  False, False, True, False, False, True
5. >, <, =, !=, >=, <=
6. == is compare two value to a Boolean, = is store a value into a variable
7. Condition is what set in a flow control statement to get a Boolean value
8. 
9. if spam == 1:
	print(‘Hello’)
     elif spam == 2:
	print(‘’Howdy’)
     else:
	print(‘Greetings’)
10. Control C
11. ‘break’ will move out from the loop, ‘continue’ will move to the start of the loop
12. range(10) means range from 0 automatically to 9, range(0, 10) tell the computer range will start at 0, and(0, 10, 1)tell the computer range will start at 0 and increase 1 by each time
13. For loop:
	for i in range(1, 11):
		print(i)
     While loop:
	I = 1
	while I < 11:
		print(I)
		I += 1
14. spam.bacon()
